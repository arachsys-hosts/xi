System info
===========

xi is an ASRock 4X4 BOX 4800U, with an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 4800U, integrated
AMD Renoir GPU, 32GB RAM, dual Realtek r8169 NICs, Intel AX200 wifi and a
932GB NVMe SSD.

The SSD is GPT partitioned:

  Device              Start        End    Sectors  Size Type
  /dev/nvme0n1p1       2048    1050623    1048576  512M EFI System
  /dev/nvme0n1p2    1050624 1953525134 1952474511  931G Linux filesystem

with /dev/nvme0n1p1 as /boot (vfat) and /dev/nvme0n1p2 as / (ext4).

The kernel is booted directly by the UEFI BIOS with command line

  linux.efi loglevel=2 root=/dev/nvme0n1p2 tsc=reliable

We use a 1G zram device as swap to limit SSD wear and provide a ueventd
disable rule to work around a hardware/BIOS bug with a phantom USB device
which fails to enumerate.


Upstream firmware binaries
--------------------------

The CPU microcode firmware/amd-ucode/*.bin, GPU blobs firmware/amdgpu/*.bin
and Intel AX200 wifi firmware firmware/iwlwifi-*.ucode are obtained from

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git

The firmware/regulatory.db database is obtained from

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sforshee/wireless-regdb.git

The firmware/bios/ directory contains a flash image for the deployed version
of the manufacturer's UEFI BIOS.


Kernel patches
--------------

The kernel is patched to include bcachefs from Kent's tree, and the config
selects this.
